# amzScraper
Python scraper for products sold&amp;shipped by amazon.it

Functionalities:
return an URL with more than 1 page from Amazon.it, the scraper will return a txt file including all the links found (estimated time less than a minute)

Links returned in the file will be concatenated with a string that contains amazons attribute that specifies that the product is sold and shipped by Amazon.it

Only these categories of products will end up in the amazon_products.txt generated.

Every time you run the script, both files will be cleared.

Also you can decide to open all links sold by amazon by clicking the last button with your desired browser (don't recommend to open more than 20 links altogether)
